ADORE BEAUTY SALON is on a mission—to offer hair and makeup services and products in a welcoming environment, with a focus on promoting and supporting inclusion and the well-being of our customers, employees and community.</p>

<p style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif">More than 3 years ago, I envisioned a hair and makeup salon inspired by red hair and changing the looks of customer beautiful , explosively visual fabulousness. I wanted my salon to be like that also, a place where everyone feels they can come to be seen and supported while expressing their unique identity.</p>

<p style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif">Today, that original vision has shifted, pushed to change by listening to the voices that most matter: yours. We have pivoted to focus on all makeup looks and hair colors, all waves and curls and coils, all voices and people, creating a sea of colors and waves as our visual power. Our expert stylists still give customers personal attention in our boutique salons, while also—just as importantly—protecting people’s hearts and bodies. We have four locations and extended hours so we are available when and where you need us. Come join us in our ever-evolving movement towards creating positive change in the salon industry!</p>
